# PMAction — open work

## Carrier update

- Certify the lowest positive carrier level on the full 216-dimensional operator, then certify the spin-up rms radius in Lean. The exact subspace calculation is in `tools/carrier_mode_exact.py` and `tools/carrier_rms_certificate.py`; the full-space level ordering still uses floating point.
- Derive the local axial variation of the two-slice update, including its wall and inter-slice terms. The [hadron calculation](../PMHadrons/REVIEW-AND-NEXT.md) needs this current and pion source.

## Dynamics and limits

- Construct the map from background `Config` to the `RecordSupply` stream used by `ReferenceSelection`. Physical allocation of the banks is a [machine-layer dependency](Machine/REVIEW-AND-NEXT.md).
- Establish shared group and trace normalization across spacings. Multi-pass root words are tracked in the machine review.
- Identify the directional-exponential completion with the on-site completion, or specify the conditions for their agreement.
- Establish mode and domain control for the real-space PDE limit, the integrated Hessian, the full real-space fermion field and interacting-field estimates.
