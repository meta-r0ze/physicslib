## Carrier update

- Certify the lowest positive carrier level on the full 216-dimensional operator, then certify the spin-up rms radius in Lean. The exact subspace calculation is in `tools/carrier_mode_exact.py` and `tools/carrier_rms_certificate.py`; the full-space level ordering still uses floating point.
- Find the physical axial current of the carrier. The two-slice update's own local axial rotation is the slice sign: it commutes with every hop and the on-site term and is broken only by the inter-slice coupling, and its link current `sym(S v_j)` is exactly normalized for free carriers (`tools/slice_axial.py`). On the confined carrier it gives `0.22–0.45` (`n = 3…8`) against the on-site `Σ_z` `0.83–0.67`, extrapolating to about `0.5` against `0.65`: with two slices the wall leakage is `O(1)`, so this current neither confirms the on-site operator nor gives a usable `g_A`. Next candidates: the many-slice limit of the wall, or the vector-axial Ward identity at nonzero momentum transfer. The [hadron calculation](../PMHadrons/REVIEW-AND-NEXT.md) needs this current and pion source.

## Dynamics and limits

- Construct the map from background `Config` to the `RecordSupply` stream used by `ReferenceSelection`. Physical allocation of the banks is a [machine-layer dependency](Machine/REVIEW-AND-NEXT.md).
- Establish shared group and trace normalization across spacings. Multi-pass root words are tracked in the machine review.
- Identify the directional-exponential completion with the on-site completion, or specify the conditions for their agreement.
- Establish mode and domain control for the real-space PDE limit, the integrated Hessian, the full real-space fermion field and interacting-field estimates.
